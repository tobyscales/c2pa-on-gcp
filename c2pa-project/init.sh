# A wrapper script to securely initialize Terraform.
#
# It intelligently detects the project ID in the following order of precedence:
#   1. From the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable (from gcloud config).
#   2. From the TF_VAR_project_id environment variable.
#
# IMPORTANT: This script MUST be run using 'source' or '.' so it can
# set the TF_VAR_project_id environment variable for your current shell session.
#
# Example Usage:
#   source ./init.sh
#   . ./init.sh

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
